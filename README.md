# Northroot-Labs workspace

Meta-repo for the org workspace: scope config, clone/sync scripts, and agent rules. Repo contents live under `repos/` (separate clones); this repo does not track them.

- **Layout and workflows:** [WORKSPACE.md](WORKSPACE.md)
- **Scope (narrow/widen):** [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) — current focal point: **Hyena** (docs + hyena-rs)

Run `./scripts/clone-default.sh` then `./scripts/sync.sh` to populate `repos/` per `repos.yaml`.
