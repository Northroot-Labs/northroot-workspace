# Northroot-Labs org workspace — agent instructions (editor-agnostic)

**Scoped context:** Defined in **WORKSPACE_SCOPE.md** (workspace root). Read it and restrict work to the paths stated there unless the user explicitly expands scope. Full agent-agnostic instructions: **repos/docs/internal/workspace/AGENTS.md**; northroot-workspaces: **northroot-workspaces/README.md**.

## Entrypoint and enforcement
- **Enter a mode:** `./northroot-workspaces/enter.sh <mode> [--sync]`. Modes in **repos/docs/internal/workspace/modes.yaml**.
- **Hard enforcement:** For scope-checked runs, use `./northroot-workspaces/exec.sh [--] <command> [args...]`. Fails closed if cwd or path args are out of scope; requires scope set (enter.sh) and writes **scope.json** (machine-readable) for tools.
- **Source of truth:** GitHub for org; metadata (topology, modes) in **repos/docs/internal/workspace/**.

## Workflows
- Sync: `./northroot-workspaces/enter.sh <mode> --sync` or `./scripts/sync.sh`
- List/clone: `./scripts/list-repos.sh`, `./scripts/clone-default.sh`
- Conventions and runbooks: **repos/docs** (security, access, GitHub). No long-lived secrets in workspace or tool config; use short-lived tokens.
