# Northroot-Labs org workspace — agent instructions

## Source of truth
- **GitHub** is the source of truth for the Northroot-Labs org. Local clones in `repos/` are a mirror.
- Before making changes that span repos or depend on latest code, ensure the workspace is synced: run `./scripts/sync.sh` from the workspace root (or ask the user to).

## Workspace layout
- Workspace root is the Northroot-Labs org directory. All org repos live under `repos/<repo-name>/` (e.g. `repos/docs`, `repos/orchard-data`, `repos/orchard-core`).
- Canonical org docs and standards live in **repos/docs** (Northroot-Labs/docs on GitHub). Security standard, GitHub App plan, and cross-repo links are specified in that repo's issues and docs.
- When a task touches multiple repos, work under `repos/` and use relative paths from the workspace root (e.g. `repos/docs/internal/security/`, `repos/orchard-data/docs/`).

## Reproducible workflows
- **List repos and local status:** `./scripts/list-repos.sh`
- **Clone default set:** `./scripts/clone-default.sh`
- **Sync with GitHub (pull all):** `./scripts/sync.sh`
- Use these scripts rather than ad-hoc git commands when the intent is "align local with org" or "ensure default repos are present."

## GitHub as live context
- When you need **current GitHub state** (open issues, PRs, project items, merge status), use the **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) or **GitHub API** from the workspace. Do not rely only on local git or stale docs.
- Reference: **repos/docs/internal/access/github/GITHUB_CONTEXT_AND_CLI.md** for commands and patterns (org repos, projects, issues, PRs). Keep that doc updated when adding new workflows.

## Conventions
- Prefer editing files under `repos/<name>/` so changes are inside the correct repo and commit boundaries stay clear.
- Do not add long-lived secrets or GitHub App keys to this workspace or to Cursor config; use short-lived tokens or the (future) token service per org security standard.
- When adding cross-repo links or references, point to canonical paths in **repos/docs** (e.g. `internal/security/SECRETS_AND_IDENTITY_STANDARD.md`, `internal/access/github/GITHUB_APP_ORG_PLAN.md`) or to GitHub URLs.
